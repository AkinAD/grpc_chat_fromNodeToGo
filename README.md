# grpc_chat_fromNodeToGo
Followed a bunch of tutorials to make this !


See accompanying react app here https://github.com/AkinAD/grpc-chat-app/tree/master


Make file contains all of the commands ( except stuff for the react app- see [package.json](https://github.com/AkinAD/grpc-chat-app/blob/master/package.json) for that) that are needed to run this application.

Start envoy and redis with `make setup`
Start server with `make serverRun`
